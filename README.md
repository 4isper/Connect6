Two players, Black and White, alternately place two stones of their own colour, 
black and white respectively, on empty intersections of a Go-like board, 
except that Black (the first player) places one stone only for the first move. 
The one who gets six or more stones in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) 
first wins the game.
